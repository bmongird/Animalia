# Animalia
Welcome to Animalia! This is an environment where animals are able to roam free! In classroom mode, use the device's microphone to measure the loudness in the room. If you're being too loud, the animals will get scared and run away. In productivity mode, simply enjoy the quirky animals and nice scenery, with a clock to keep you focused and on time.
